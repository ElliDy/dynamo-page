# Dynamo Dresden User Interfaces

## Intent of this repository
The first intend of this repository is, that it is playground for me as a ui creator to try out things.
As IÂ´m a big Dynamo Dresden Fan, I like to try to connect always the content of my try outs to content, which could might be helpful for fans of this football club.

If you like to join me, please open a branch and realize your ideas.
